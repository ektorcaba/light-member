Ultra low resources member plugin, turn your site in a membership site.

== Description ==

Offer exclusive content for members on your site with this plugin and charge for access through Stripe.

A very easy-to-configure plugin that doesn't require many resources, very lightweight, designed to do just what is necessary.

You won't need anything else to have your membership site.

I'm not happy with how plugins have been working lately. They say they're free, and then you have to pay for everything, making WordPress very heavy. I don't do that. This plugin is 100% free, but I ask that if it has helped you, please consider making a donation. As long as I receive donations, I'll make sure to keep this plugin alive.
